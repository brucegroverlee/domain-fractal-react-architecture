Welcome to the official demonstration repository of the Domain-Fractal React Architecture (DFRA), a new approach to structuring React applications for scalability, maintainability, and ease of development. DFRA blends the concepts of `domain-driven` design with a `fractal project structure`, aiming to streamline the development process for large-scale applications by clearly separating concerns and promoting modular growth.

## Enable DFRA custom eslint rules

```
npm run lint:update-rules

npm install eslint-plugin-dfra-rules@file:.eslint-plugin-dfra-rules
```
