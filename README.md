Welcome to the official demonstration repository of the Domain-Fractal React Architecture (DFRA), a new approach to structuring React applications for scalability, maintainability, and ease of development. DFRA blends the concepts of `domain-driven` design with a `fractal project structure`, aiming to streamline the development process for large-scale applications by clearly separating concerns and promoting modular growth.
